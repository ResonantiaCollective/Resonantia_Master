# Resonantia_Master — Root Overview

**Resonantia_Master** is the unified root of the **Resonantia Collective**:  
a multi-branch creative ecosystem spanning game development, music, lore, and broadcast.

This repository serves as the **structural spine** that binds all major Resonantia domains together while allowing each to evolve independently.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

Resonantia operates on a dual-track doctrine:

- **Independent growth**
- **Shared canon**

Each branch has full autonomy in execution,  
yet all branches resolve into a single, consistent universe.

---

## 1. Project_Dissonance  
**(Game Universe & Codex Authority)**

`Project_Dissonance` is the core development and canonical authority of the Resonantia Game Universe.

It includes:

- **Cyber-Sacred Codex**
  - Living Bible (canon, scrolls, doctrine)
  - Technical Codices (player systems, combat engines, rulesets)
- **Game Prototype**
  - Built in Godot
  - Core rhythm-combat and system experimentation
- **Card & House Systems**
  - House doctrine, sequencing, and mechanics
- **Audio for the Game**
  - In-universe music, motifs, and system-driven sound design
- **Operative Framework**
  - Operative profiles
  - Lore entities
  - Integration protocols
- **Art & Visual Pipelines**
  - Concept art
  - UI/UX experiments
- **Progress Tracking**
  - Logs, milestones, and archival backups

This branch defines **what is canon**.

## 2. Resonantia_Records  
**(Music Label & Public Transmission Layer)**

`Resonantia_Records` is the music label and broadcast arm of the Resonantia Collective.

It translates the Codex into **real-world signal**.

It includes:

- **Artist Structure**
  - Primary artist and future operatives
- **Release Catalog**
  - Official releases (RR###)
- **DJ Sets & Performances**
  - Canon transmissions (e.g. *First Pulse*)
- **Sample Packs**
  - Tools for creation and community use
- **Branding & Promotion Assets**
  - Covers, templates, and visual identity
- **Administrative & Operational Records**
  - Export logs
  - Render notes
  - Archival documentation

Not all music here is canon —  
but **all canon music is archived here**.

---

## 3. 04_BRANDING  
**(Shared Visual Authority)**

Centralized branding assets used across **all Resonantia branches**.

Contains:

- Logos & sigils  
- Font kits  
- Color palettes  
- Visual and layout templates  

This folder ensures **visual consistency** across game, music, and public communication.

---

## 4. .vscode  
**(Workflow Consistency)**

Editor configuration to ensure a stable and consistent development workflow across environments.

---

## CANON NOTE

Certain events within Resonantia are formally sealed as **Canon Events**.

- **Canon Event 001:**  
  *First Pulse Transmission* — public signal established  
  (See Living Bible v4.0, Scroll 009)

Canon Events are **immutable reference points**.  
Future work may evolve from them — never overwrite them.

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

This master tree exists to ensure that:

- The **game** can grow without being constrained by the label  
- The **music** can transmit without being reduced to soundtrack  
- The **Codex** remains authoritative  
- The **archive** remains truthful  

Resonantia is not a single product.  
It is a **living system**.
