# MOLLYTUDE // ONI13 — EPK BIO

MollyTude // ONI13 (MT//13) is a hard techno / acid / industrial
signal built for peak-time systems.

Relentless kick pressure, resonant TB-style squelch,
metallic machine loops, and ritual atmospheres define
the sound.

MollyTude is the human signal.
ONI13 is the masked machine-spirit.

Together they transmit machine rituals under
Resonantia_Records.
